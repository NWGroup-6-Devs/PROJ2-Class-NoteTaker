## Tech Used

This web page was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, Handlebars, node, express, and a Sequelize ORM. Our team utilized (INSERT NAME) – a public CSS library – to create a more aesthetically pleasing interface for the user. Moreover, we made use of Kanban on GitHub to create, delegate, and manage tasks for this project.

During the initial stages of the project, we used a wire-framing tool to create a blueprint for the web page, which helped us visualize and establish a preliminary structural layout. A skeleton was created for each individual page of our application. Below, please find images of out initial schematics, which were created on wireframe.cc.
