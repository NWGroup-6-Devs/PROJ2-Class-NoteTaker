# WENDI!

## Description/Motivation
Are you attending an online course and looking for an effective way to create and store notes? While some may prefer the traditional paper-and-pencil method, we believe that a virtual note-taking application can provide students with an intuitive, systematic and efficient way to record lessons, file notes and archive data throughout the course of a semester or academic year. Plus: By opting for a virtual application, we guarantee that you will never break a sweat fretting over broken lead, notebooks with limited space or ink-smudged hands ever again, at least not while taking notes!

Wendi, your personalized note-taking application, allows you to do all the above in a secure, user-friendly location. Each account is username and password-protected, so only the creator of the notes has direct access to them. In terms of user-friendliness, we aimed to create a minimalistic, streamlined platform with JavaScript-activated buttons. 

Our application utilizes SQL to store user data and other information (e.g., time stamps), which can be retrieved from the back-end database and displayed on the web page via user requests. Additionally, users’ log-in credentials will also be recorded and saved in a database created via SQL.

## Installation
To access our application, click on the following link (INSERT LINK HERE). If you have successfully reached the web page, you will see the landing page below:

Note: This page will ask the user to enter their log-in credentials (i.e., the username and password they created with their account). Please note that a user will not be able to access additional web pages or utilize the applications various functions before an account has been created.

## Usage
As mentioned above, this web page consists of three interfaces: the log-in page, a page where the user can create new notes with titles and time stamps, as well as a note archive via which the user can go back and look at saved notes.

## Tech Used
This web page was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Handlebars, node, express, and a Sequelize ORM. Our team utilized (INSERT NAME) – a public CSS library – to create a more aesthetically pleasing interface for the user. Moreover, we made use of Kanban on GitHub to create, delegate, and manage tasks for this project; tasks were divided into two groups: front-end and back-end.
During the initial stages of the project, we used a wire-framing tool to create a blueprint for the web page, which helped us visualize and establish a preliminary structural layout. A skeleton was created for each individual page of our application. Below, please find images of our initial schematics, which were created on wireframe.cc.
